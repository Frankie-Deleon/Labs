   * Public class DeleonOlsenON1PA2:
   * a program that computes annual sales revenue to-date to determine
   * the status of the company�s sales revenue and whether a year-end bonus is in store for the
   * employees. Sales revenue is captured by month within a quarter; therefore, the user can enter as
   * many quarters as needed as long as the quarters are not less than 1 or greater than 4. If sales
   * revenue is on target by 50% or more for a sales rep, an encouraging message is sent; otherwise,
   * a warning is sent. If sales revenue to date for the company is greater than or equal to 100% of
   * projected annual sales, then employees qualify for a 2-5% year-end bonus; otherwise, no yearend bonus can be expected. Use printf() with format specifiers where needed.
